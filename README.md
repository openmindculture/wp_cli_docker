# WordPress Test Setup

[wp_cli_docker](https://github.com/openmindculture/wp_cli_docker) is a simple local host WordPress setup using Docker, docker-compose, and wp-cli to install themes and plugins, so that we can quickly evaluate and ensure compatibility of a certain setup of components and software versions.

We can use the incompatibility-checker plugin for a quick overview of WordPress Core, PHP, and themes versions with a specific focus on support for the block editor, custom blocks, and (full) site editing compatibilities.
